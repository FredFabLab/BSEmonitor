# About BSEmonitor
This is a small Android app for monitoring building services and consumption, i. e. water, electricity and well (including well).
It is specifically developed for a DIY-man in Mwanza, Tanzania, but can (more or less) easily adjusted to your needs. Feel free to do so and publish your code here.

The app supports currently the following categories:
* **Domestic**
* **Outdoor**
* **Animals**
* **Community**
* **Pump**
* **Well**

In each category, there are several numeric data entries.
All the data is stored as per-day entry in an internal database, but export to csv is possible.
There's also an internal statistics feature, which gives you see all entries as a list, development over time, totals and averages.

# Development environment
This project is developed within the [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu).
This graphical programming interface is easy-to-use and doesn't need any local computing, since it's running on server – in your web browser.
You just sign up with your Google account and are ready to code.
You can also real-time preview your code on device or in an emulator. Instructions on installation are found on their [Getting Started site](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/get-started).

## How to im- and export
For installing on Android devices, download the latest .apk from [releases](https://github.com/fredFabLab/BSEmonitor/releases) to your device.
For editing the app, download any .aia and import it into the App Inventor (online). From there you can download the updated .aia and share it here.
