# About BSEmonitor

This is a small Android app for monitoring building services and consumption, i. e. water, electricity and well (including well).
It is specifically developed for a DIY-man in Mwanza, Tanzania, but can (more or less) easily adjusted to your needs. Feel free to do so and publish your code here.

The app supports currently the following categories:
* **Domestic**
* **Farm**
* **Electricity**
* **Community**
* **Pump**
* **Well**

In each category, there are several numeric data entries.
All the data is stored as per-day entry in an internal database, but export to csv is possible.
There's also an internal statistics feature, which gives you see all entries as a list, development over time, totals and averages.

This project is developed within the [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu).
This graphical programming interface is easy-to-use and doesn't need any local computing, since it's running on server – in your web browser.
You just sign up with your Google account and are ready to code.
You can also real-time preview your code on device or in an emulator. Instructions on installation are found on their [Getting Started site](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/get-started).
It's an open source project, you can find the source [here on GitHub](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources).
